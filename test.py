# Print numbers from 10 to 200 using the while loop
# Your numbers must be in multiples of 10.
# 10 must be first number printed, and 200 the last number.
# Example: 10, 20, 30 ..... 180, 190, 200.
# Note that the numbers do not need to be printed in one line.
# Write your code here


# num = 0

# while num < 200:

# Task 2
# Code a password checker to protect your code!

# Assign a password "superpass123" to a variable

# If the password does not match, print “Access Denied”

# Write your code here

# Basic List Functions
# Do the following operations to the list provided below
# Write the code below each question.

# planets = ["mercury","venus", "earth", "mars", "jupiter", "saturn", "uranus" ]

# # 1. Write code below to print the 3rd item 
# #    in this list using index e.g. earth

# print(planets[2])


# # 2. Write code to append neptune to this list.

# planets.append("neptune")

# print(planets)


# # 3. Elon Musk has conquered Mars. 
# #    Rename Mars in the list to be "muskworld"

# planets[3] = "muskworld"

# print(planets)


# # 4. Remove uranus from this list.

# del(planets[6])

# print(planets)


# # 5. Using a for loop, print all the planets 
# #    from this list one by one.

# for item in planets:
#     print(item)

# word = "hello"
# word = "hello 1 "
# word = word * 2
